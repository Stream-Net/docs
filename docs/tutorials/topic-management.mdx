# Topic Management
Sometimes, we need to build an app to manage our topics, and give more governance in brokers, to easily develop our tasks.
For this purpose, we delivered some methods to make our life simple.

### Configuring application startup
To enable topic management in your app, you can add this feature in Startup.cs or Program.cs(in case of .net 6 or later) with the following line.
``` cs 
builder.Services.AddTopicManagement();
```
After doing this, the interface ITopicManagement will be ready to use.

### Using the ITopicManagement interface
To use topic management tools, first, you'll need to inject the ITopicManagement interface, as you can see next
``` cs 
public class CreateTopicUseCase : ICreateTopicUseCase
{
    private readonly ITopicManagement _topicManagement;

    public CreateTopicUseCase(ITopicManagement topicManagement)
    {
        _topicManagement = topicManagement;
    }
}
```
### Creating a new topic
To create a new topic, just use the ```CreateTopicAsync``` method.
The method, can receive 3 parameters: 
**topicName**: the name of topic to create.
**replicationFactor**: the replication factor of topic. More information about replication factor [here.](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops)
**numberOfPartitions**: the number of partitions for your topic. More information about topic partitioning [here.](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms)

### Deleting a single topic
To create a new topic, just use the ```DeleteTopicAsync``` method.
The method, can receive 1 parameter: 
**topicName**: the name of topic to delete.

### Deleting a range of topics
To create a new topic, just use the ```DeleteTopicsAsync``` method.
The method, can receive 1 parameter: 
**topicNames**: a list with the name of topics to delete.

### Getting topic metadata
You can retrieve the topic information from your topic, to make use of this, just call the ```GetTopicData``` method.
The method, can receive 1 parameter: 
**topicName**: the name of topic to retrieve metadata.

### Getting topics metadata
You can retrieve the topic information from all your topics, to make use of this, just call the ```GetTopicsData``` method.
The method, didn't receive any parameters.
